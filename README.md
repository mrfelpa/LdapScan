# Possible Errors and Troubleshooting



- ***ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ldap':*** This error occurs when the python-ldap module is not installed. Make sure you have installed the python-ldap module using the command mentioned in the "Dependencies" section.


- ***ldap.SERVER_DOWN:*** This error indicates that the LDAP server is not accessible or is down. Check the host and port configuration and ensure that the ***LDAP server is running and reachable.***


- ***ldap.TIMEOUT:*** This error occurs when the LDAP server does not respond within the specified timeout period. You can try increasing the timeout value using the --timeout argument when running the script.


- ***ldap.INSUFFICIENT_ACCESS:*** This error indicates that the null bind is not allowed on the ***LDAP server.*** The script requires null bind access to perform the necessary tests. Ensure that the LDAP server allows null bind access or provide valid credentials ***using the --bind-dn and --bind-password arguments when running the script.***
